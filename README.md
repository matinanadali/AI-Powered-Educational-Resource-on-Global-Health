# AI-Powered Educational Resource on the Topic of "Global Health"
###### This web app was developed as part of an assignment for the CIVIS BIP course "AI & STEAM: Changing Learning, Shaping Futures."

#### Description

This application is designed to assist teachers, lecturers, and learners of all educational levels in exploring global health challenges, key events, and scientific figures who have revolutionized global health. It highlights the contributions of each of the STEM principles in strengthening global health, offering users the ability to select specific areas of focus based on their interests.

The app is powered by the GOOGLE GEMINI API, which generates personalized learning content tailored to the learner's age and chosen focus areas.

#### Limitations
The application is still in its early stages, and there is room for significant improvement (see the TODO section below). Additionally, it currently utilizes the free tier of the GEMINI API, which limits the number of requests.

#### TODO
- ~~Make the application responsive~~.
- Organize the code into modules and files (a lot more work added here...).
- Add a "Back to Home" button (not a priority right now).
- ~~Improve colors and styling~~.
- Incorporate "activity duration (probably just add a clock or something like this).
